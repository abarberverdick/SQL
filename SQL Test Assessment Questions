## These are SQL test assessment questions and answers from a SQL Udemy course taught by Jose Portilla.

## The data involved in the questions is from an exercise database involving two schemas; public and cd. The following questions will be from the cd schema. 
## Cd schema has three tables; facilities, members, and bookings. Facilites table contains the following: facility id, name, member cost, guest cost, initial outlay, and 
## monthly maintanence. 
## Bookings table contains booking id, facility id, member id, start time and slots. 
## Members table contains member id, surname, first name, address, zipcode, telephone number, recommended by, and join date. 


## The first 6 questions involve the facilities table.

1. How can you retrieve all of the information from the cd.facilties table? 
SELECT * 
FROM cd.facilities; 

2. You want to print out a list of all of the facilities and their cost to members. How would you retrieve a list of only facility names and costs?
SELECT name, membercost
FROM cd.facilities

3. How can you produce a list of facilities that charge a fee to members? 
SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM cd.facilities
WHERE membercost > 0;

4. How can you produce a list of facilities that charge a fee to members, and that fee is less than 1/50th of the monthly maintanence cost? 
Return the facid, facility name, member cost, and monthly maintenance of the facilities in question. 

SELECT facid, name, membercost, monthly maintanence
FROM cd.facilities
WHERE membercost > 0 AND
(membercost < (1/50.0) * monthlymaintainence); 

5. How can you produce a lost of all facilities with the word "Tennis" in their name?
SELECT *
FROM cd.facilities
WHERE name LIKE '%tennis%';

6. How can you retrieve the details of facilities with id 1 and 5? 
SELECT * 
FROM cd.facilities
WHERE facid IN (1,5);

## The following 3 questions involve data from the members table

7. How can you produce a list of members who joined after the start of September 2012? Return memid, surname, firstname, joindate of the members of question.
SELECT memid, surname, firstname, joindate
FROM cd.members
WHERE joindate >= '2012-09-01';

8. How can you produce an ordered list of the first 10 surnames in the members table? List must not contain duplicates.
SELECT DISTINCT surname
FROM cd.members
ORDER BY surname ASC
LIMIT 10;

9. You'd like to get the signup date of your last member. How can you retrieve this information?
SELECT joindate
FROM cd.members
ORDER BY joindate DESC
LIMIT 1;

10. Produce a count of the number of facilities that have a cost to guests of 10 or more.
SELECT COUNT(guestcost)
FROM cd.facilities
WHERE guestcost > 10; 

11. Produce a list of the total number of slots booked per facility in the month of September 2012. Produce an output table consisting of facility id and slots,
sorted by the number of slots.

SELECT facid, SUM(slots) AS "Total Slots"
FROM cd.bookings
WHERE starttime >= '2012-09-01' AND starttime < '2012-10-01'
GROUP BY facid
ORDER BY SUM(slots); 

12. Produce a list with more than 1000 slots booked. Produce an output table consisting of facility id and total slots, sorted by facility id.
SELECT facid, SUM(slots) AS "Total Slots"
FROM cd.bookings
GROUP BY facid
HAVING SUM(slots) > 1000
ORDER BY facid;
