## Analysis of Walmart Sales using Google Sheets, PostgreSQL, and Tableau. Data is from Kaggle. 

1. I first converted all dates into a text format since not all dates were represented in a date format. 
  =TEXT(cell #, "dd-mm-yyyy")

2. Converted all text dates back into a date format with the format "mm-dd-yyyy"
  =DATE(RIGHT(cell#,2), MID(cell#,4,2), LEFT(cell#,2))

3. Checked for NULL cells and replaced with appropriate data, if applicable. 

4. Saved cleaned data into a .csv file. 

5. Created table in PostgreSQL
CREATE TABLE walmart (
store INTEGER,
date TIMESTAMP,
weekly_sales NUMERIC(9,2),
holiday INTEGER,
temperature NUMERIC(5,2),
fuel_price NUMERIC(4,2),
CPI NUMERIC(10,7),
unemployment NUMERIC(5,3)
);

6. Imported .csv file into created table

7. Obtained top 10 weekly sales across all stores
SELECT * FROM walmart
ORDER BY weekly_sales DESC
LIMIT 10

**still working on the analysis, but this is my start so far**
